# Channel List

A quick little application to help find channels in the absence of any usable channel guide.

This app is built with Kotlin/JS and React. It is built with Gradle and deployed to Heroku. You can read more about this project [on my website](https://jackwarren.info/posts/projects/channel-list/).
