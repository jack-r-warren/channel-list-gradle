[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f320600e-4bfa-4869-9519-91f7f4e8fc99/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jackwarren-channel-list/deploys)

A quick little application to help find channels in the absence of any usable channel guide.

This app is built with Kotlin/JS and React. It is built with Gradle on Travis CI and deployed to Netlify. You can read more about this project [on my website](https://jackwarren.info/posts/projects/channel-list/).
